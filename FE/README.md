   - Semantic HTML, accessibility best practices.
   - Forms, tables, and multimedia tags.
2. **CSS**:
   - CSS basics, Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.
   - Preprocessors like SASS or LESS.
   - CSS frameworks: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - ES6+ features: let/const, arrow functions, template literals.
   - DOM manipulation, event listeners, and fetch API.
   - Advanced concepts: promises, async/await, closures, and modules.

## Part 2: React Basics
1. **Introduction to React**:
   - React components (functional and class-based).
   - JSX syntax and expressions.
   - Props and state management.
2. **React Hooks**:
   - useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks.
3. **Event Handling**:
   - Synthetic events and handling form inputs.
4. **Styling in React**:
   - CSS modules, styled-components, and Tailwind CSS.

## Part 3: Advanced React
1. **State Management**:
   - Context API for local state.
   - Redux or Zustand for global state management.
2. **Routing**:
   - React Router for client-side navigation.
   - Dynamic routing and route guards.
3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback.
   - Lazy loading and code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.
4. **Testing React Apps**:
   - Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
   - End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright.

---

## Part 4: Frameworks and Tooling
1. **Next.js (React Framework)**:
   - Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
   - API routes and data fetching.
   - Image optimization and incremental static regeneration.
2. **Build Tools**:
   - Package managers: npm, yarn, or pnpm.
   - Bundlers: Webpack, Vite, or Parcel.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Git basics, branching, merging, and pull requests.

---

## Part 5: APIs and Backend Integration
1. **REST APIs**:
   - Fetch data using Axios or Fetch API.
   - Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. **GraphQL**:
   - Query and mutate data using Apollo Client or Relay.
3. **WebSockets**:
   - Real-time communication with libraries like Socket.IO.

---

## Part 6: Authentication & Authorization
1. **Authentication**:
   - OAuth2, JWT, and session-based authentication.
   - Integrating third-party providers (Google, Facebook, etc.).
2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control.
   - Securing routes and components.

---

## Part 7: Testing
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Writing test cases for React components.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Testing API integration and flows.
3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Use Cypress for comprehensive UI testing.

---

## Part 8: Deployment and DevOps
1. **Build and Deployment**:
   - Create production-ready builds.
   - Deploy on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.
2. **CI/CD**:
   - Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions.
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Integrate error tracking with Sentry.
   - Monitor performance using Lighthouse.

---

## Part 9: Advanced Topics
1. **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**:
   - Add offline capabilities and installability.
2. **TypeScript**:
   - Type-safe React components and state management.
3. **Web Performance**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).
4. **Internationalization (i18n)**:
   - Use libraries like react-intl or i18next.

---

### Suggested Projects
1. Build a personal portfolio with React and Tailwind CSS.
2. Develop a weather dashboard using public APIs.
3. Create a task manager with React, Redux, and local storage.
4. Build an e-commerce platform with Next.js and a mock backend.

---

### Suggested Learning Path
1. Master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
2. Learn React and its ecosystem.
3. Dive into Next.js and backend integration.
4. Explore advanced topics like TypeScript, PWAs, and performance optimization.
