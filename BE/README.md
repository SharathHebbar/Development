# Backend Development Roadmap: FastAPI

## Part 1: Fundamentals
### Core Programming Skills
1. **Python Basics**:
   - Syntax, data types, control structures, OOP concepts.
   - Python standard libraries: `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `collections`, `itertools`, `functools`.
2. **Advanced Python**:
   - Decorators, context managers, typing, metaclasses.
   - Async programming with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Git basics, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
   - Writing meaningful commit messages and pull requests.

## Part 2: FastAPI Basics
1. **Introduction**:
   - Setting up FastAPI and exploring its features.
   - Basics of routes, path parameters, and query parameters.
2. **Request and Response**:
   - Handling JSON payloads, request bodies, and response models.
   - File uploads and form data.
3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Reusable components using FastAPI's dependency injection system.
4. **Validation with Pydantic**:
   - Data validation and parsing.
   - Custom validators and settings management.

---

## Part 3: Database Integration
1. **Relational Databases**:
   - PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
   - Integrate SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM.
2. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Use MongoDB or DynamoDB for NoSQL workflows.
3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Use Alembic or Tortoise migrations.
4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Normalize data and define relationships (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many).

---

## Part 4: APIs and Web Services
1. **REST APIs**:
   - Building CRUD operations.
   - Versioning and best practices.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Automatic API docs with OpenAPI and Swagger.
3. **GraphQL**:
   - Integrate GraphQL using libraries like Strawberry or Ariadne.
4. **WebSockets**:
   - Implement real-time communication using FastAPI.

---

## Part 5: Authentication & Authorization
1. **Authentication**:
   - OAuth2, JWT, and session-based authentication.
   - Third-party login integrations (e.g., Google, Facebook).
2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based and permission-based access control.
3. **Password Management**:
   - Secure password hashing with `bcrypt` or `argon2`.

---

## Part 6: Testing
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Pytest basics and writing test cases.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test API endpoints using FastAPI's TestClient.
3. **Mocking**:
   - Mock database calls, external APIs, and dependencies.

---

## Part 7: Deployment and DevOps
1. **Docker**:
   - Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization.
2. **Web Servers**:
   - Use Gunicorn or Uvicorn with Nginx for production.
3. **CI/CD**:
   - Automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
4. **Cloud Deployment**:
   - Deploy to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
   - Use managed databases and load balancers.

---

## Part 8: Security
1. **API Security**:
   - Prevent XSS, SQL injection, CSRF.
   - Use CORS headers and HTTPS.
2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store secrets securely using `.env` files.
3. **Encryption**:
   - Implement symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

---

## Part 9: Advanced Topics
1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Write non-blocking code using async/await.
2. **Task Queues**:
   - Use Celery or RabbitMQ for background tasks.
3. **Caching**:
   - Redis for caching database queries or API responses.
4. **Microservices**:
   - Design and deploy independent services.
5. **System Design**:
   - Learn scalable architectures, database sharding, and indexing.

---

### Suggested Projects
1. Build a RESTful API for a library management system.
2. Create a real-time chat application using WebSockets.
3. Develop a user authentication and role-based access control system.
4. Build a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform.

---

### Suggested Learning Path
1. Start with Python and basic FastAPI.
2. Learn database integration and ORM tools.
3. Implement authentication, testing, and deployment.
4. Explore advanced topics like caching, microservices, and system design.
